# Password Generator Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a password generator that used uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters after asking for criteria.

I learned to make alerts, prompts, boolean functions, compile a string, and how to use a random number generator.

## Usage

1. Input length of desired password.
2. Choose whether or not to include uppercase letters in password.
3. Choose whether or not to include lowercase letters in password.
4. Choose whether or not to include numbers in password.
5. Choose whether or not to include special characters in password.
